# Predator-Analysis
Predator Data Analysis is a software package that is mainly designed to process FT-ICR MS data collected with the Predator Data Acquisition software package.
Please feel free to submit any software issues to the team. The "issues" button above is the place to submit such requests. Please remember that Predator Analysis is a GUI driven analysis and so as many specifics (for instance the number of spectra that have been open in the current session, length of session prior of said issue, step that can be taken to recreate the problem, version of Predatro Analysis involved, etc.) that can be included greatly aid in recreation of many issues.
