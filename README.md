# Predator-Analysis
Predator Data Analysis is a software package that is mainly designed to process FT-ICR MS data collected with the Predator Data Acquisition software package.
Please feel free to submit any software issues to the team. Please remember that Predator Analysis is a GUI driven analysis and so any specifics (for instance the number of spectra that have been open in the current sesiion) that can be included greatly aid in recreation of many issues.
